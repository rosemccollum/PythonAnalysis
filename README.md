Project Overview: We are developing a Python-based data analysis and visualization pathway for the TNE Lab.

Short-Term Objectives (End of 2021): An Python-based architecture that pulls raw data, automatically runs it through analysis pipeline, and creates/saves visuals into folders by animal and day.

Long-Term Objectives (TBD): Debug and expand to fit growing needs of TNE Lab - How can we use this project to produce visuals that contextualize what we are trying to accomplish at a lab-wide level.
