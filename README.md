Initial objectives: Create a Python-based pathway for data visualiztion similar to what Virginia is currently running. Then we can expand our Pandas and Seaborn skills to show existing data to the rest of the team in new ways.

Long Term Objectives: An Python-based architecture that grabs raw data, automatically runs it through the 4 matlab scripts Virginia uses, and saves existing (and new) visuals into folders by animal and day, removing maybe ~10 minutes of work for each recording clearing up a lot of time when we run both stimulation boxes with animals for a full day.
